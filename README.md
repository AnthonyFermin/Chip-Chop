ChipChop is an Android location-based app that allows users to sign up as either "buyers" or "vendors", to utilize the platform and either buy or cook and sell home-cooked meals within their communities. The initial goal of the app was to promote social interaction amongst individuals within the vastly diverse neighborhoods, and allow those who have a love for cooking delicious food to have an easy way to create a virtual store and sell their creations. ChipChop fills the void for those who aren't able to get easy access to home-cooked dishes because home is far away but want to enjoy convenient access to meals cooked with love by their local neighbors and friends-to-be! 

The app utilizes Google Maps services, Facebook OAuth, Firebase database, Services, Notifications, Broadcasts/Recievers, and Google's Material Design.
