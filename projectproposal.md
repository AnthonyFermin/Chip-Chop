## The Problem 
Describe the problem that your app will address. This does not need to be a novel idea or product, but your app should not directly recreate an existing product. If you are basing the app on an existing product, there should be some edge to your design or feature that solves a problem with that existing product.   

In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?   

##### Problem: People want home cooked meals but don't have time to make them and nowadays people aren't very involved in their local communities. This app will foster a bigger sense of community by allowing people to share and interact with their neighbors. 

##### Competitors:
### Websites: 
Josephine.com
Homemadegoods.com

### Apps: 
Foodie Shares(Local to California)


##### Market-
Consumers: Targeting young professionals and everyone who is hungry for homemade food
Providers: People who love to cook

##### Use Cases:
-Professinals or anyone who is too busy to cook during the work day but want an authentic, fresh homecooked meal from someone in their community.
-A stay at home mom who loves to cook and would love to contribute to the household income while staying at
home to take care of their children.


## The Solution 
Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. You should also include:
  *  Baseline features you plan to implement by Demo 1 (what + why).
  *  Bonus features you plan to implement if baseline features are completed in time (what + why).
  *  A wireframe of the app. 
  *  
  
 ##### Baseline: 
 - Individual User accounts
 - Profiles with user/chef information, photos and meals available (including any allergens)
 - Review system for all sellers
 - Utilizing geolocation to locate local chefs and populate onto map (FOR FRESH FOOD!) also allow entry for zip code when searching as a backup for geolocation fail
 -DELIVERY: chefs can decide whether they want to deliver and/or allow pick-upusers can filter through one, other, no preference

##### Bonus Features
-integrate FB login upon account creation to verify users are real and also traceable to a certain extent
- Credit Card Payments
- Bluetooth connection when order is close by
- Shake phone for random suggestion
- Responsive UI (For time of day, Hunger Level, etc)
- Create a website

## Execution
Please describe how you will build this app. Include: 
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Implement the training from the [Project Management workshop](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-3/blob/master/lessons/16_ProjectManagement.md) to plan your sprints and outline which features you want to build out over the next 4 weeks. Think about the user stories you would frame your sprints around. *Projects should be planned to complete the build by Demo 1 on September 1, 2015.*  
  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app. 
  *  
  ##### Breakdown
  Week 1: Basic Functioning MVP
  Week 2: Finalize functioning MVP And begin bonus features
  Week 3: Finalize bonus features and design and debugging/testing

 ##### Roles and Responsibilities for Week 1:
 - Alvin: Front End Design and Layout 
 - Madelyn: Setting up and entering information to Cloud Database
