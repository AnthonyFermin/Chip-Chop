## The Problem 
Describe the problem that your app will address. This does not need to be a novel idea or product, but your app should not directly recreate an existing product. If you are basing the app on an existing product, there should be some edge to your design or feature that solves a problem with that existing product.   

In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?   

## The Solution 
Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. You should also include:
  *  Baseline features you plan to implement by Demo 1 (what + why).
  *  Bonus features you plan to implement if baseline features are completed in time (what + why).
  *  A wireframe of the app. 

## Execution
Please describe how you will build this app. Include: 
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Implement the training from the [Project Management workshop](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-3/blob/master/lessons/16_ProjectManagement.md) to plan your sprints and outline which features you want to build out over the next 4 weeks. Think about the user stories you would frame your sprints around. *Projects should be planned to complete the build by Demo 1 on September 1, 2015.*  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.
