### Problem: 
---
The problem that our app is aiming to tackle is the unfilled desire of users (especially of those in cities who are young working professionals or students in their 20-30's who do not live with family) who are looking for a convenient way to enjoy an authentically prepared and home-cooked meal. It would also provide a money-making opportunity for those who are stay-at-home parents with kids, or immigrants who don't have the necessary skills to obtain regular jobs, but have a love for cooking food of their culture or any culture for matter! 

### Solution: 
---
Our mobile app aims to create a platform that connects the 'users' with 'chefs' in their local community/neighborhood to deliver or pick-up authentic home-cooked meals! By doing so, this would also allow people to create real social connections with members of their local community, and familiarize/befriend those who live in their local area whom they might not have the chance of ever meeting in a vast city, such as NYC. 



### Competitors:
**Web**:<br> 
- Josephine.com<br>
- Homemadegoods.com

**Mobile**:<br> 
- Foodie Shares (Local to California)


### Use Cases:
**Consumers =** Primarily working professionals (20's and 30's) who are too busy to cook, but wish to enjoy a convenient, authentic, freshly prepared home-cooked meal.<br>
**Providers =** People who love to cook and would like to make some extra money on the side by sharing their cultural delicacies with locals in and around their neighborhood.
 (e.g. A stay at home mom who loves to cook and would love to contribute to the household income while staying at
home to take care of their children)



### Baseline Features:
 - Individual User accounts (Allow the users to create their own profile and store it within the Firebase cloud database with all relevant information to the user to allow easier future access to using the product with saved searches, etc.)
 - Profiles with user/chef information, location, photos and a live update of dishes currently available at the time (including any allergens)
 - Review system for all sellers (Similar to yelp's star ratings that would allow users to rate the chef in general)
 - Utilizing geolocation to locate local chefs and populate onto map (FOR FRESH FOOD!) also allow entry for zip code when searching as a backup for geolocation fail
 -DELIVERY: chefs can decide whether they want to deliver and/or allow pick-upusers can filter through one, other, no preference




### Bonus Features
-integrate FB login upon account creation to verify users are real and also traceable to a certain extent (Using the Facebook option provided by the Firebase API that will allow us to verify legitamacy of user/chef, and also provide a social platform for our app to be shared and marketed via media).
- Credit Card Payments (To allow contracted chefs to conveniently receive payments and for users to conveniently pay for food)
- Bluetooth connection when order is close by (Using Bluetooth LE to create a connection within 30 ft when the deliverer is outside the door of the recipient to provide a location-based alert notification)
- Shake phone for random suggestion (Fun feature that would utilize sensors of the phone to sense when it is being shaken to randomly select a location and cuisine for the user when the user feels too indecisive to search for something specific but would like to enjoy a homecooked meal)
- Responsive UI (That has the ability to change according to the time of day, Hunger Level, other parameters; simply to delight the user)
- Create a website (Allow for multiple forms of access to our product on different device types to increase accessibility overall and convenience of use)
- Using SendGrid API to send confirmation/forgotten password e-mails
